grpc and protocol buffers or protobufs binary based message service

binary based remote procedure calls are fast

Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.

protobuf I think requires an installation

grpcurl --plaintext localhost:9092 list

https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl - add $HOME/go/bin to $PATH in ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile

source ~/.bashrc  --- source ~/.profile

server doesnt support the reflection api

reflection.Register(gs)
