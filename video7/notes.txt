documenting restful api with swagger

note: instructor seem to be using zsh shell for windows, hence a lot of linux commands are seen to be executed without any problem

command for swagger documenting tool installer:
go get -u github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/cmd/swagger

swagger seems to be working on sample projects but not on this project for some reason
I suspect there's a problem needed to be rectified in the main.go file of this project
